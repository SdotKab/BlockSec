**Blog CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their blog posts.

**Responsive Design**: Built to be mobile-friendly and responsive across various screen sizes with Tailwindcss.

**API Integration**: Uses Express.js to handle API requests and MongoDB for storing blog data.

**Full Stack Application**: Uses Node.js for server-side rendering and React for the front-end.
